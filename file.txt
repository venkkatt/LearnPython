Old MacDonald had a farm
Ee i ee i o
And on his farm he had some cows
Ee i ee i oh
With a moo-moo here
And a moo-moo there
Here a moo,there a moo
Everywhere a moo-moo

And on his farm he had some ducks
Ee i ee i oh
With a quack-quack here
And a quack-quack there
Here a quack,there a quack
Everywhere a quack-quack
